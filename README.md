# FraudDetection

My goal with this project is to model an end-to-end Machine Learning Pipeline.

The pipeline will consist of a Flask REST API
that performs Batch Processing
on a dataset from Kaggle about Credit Card Fraud
hosted in a local SQLite Database
and returns Inference (Machine Learning Predictions)
into that dataset.

If all goes well, we'll learn a lot and also build a functioning application for Machine Learning :)
